## Shbobo

Here are some selected quotes about Shobo by themselves:

### Shbobo description at shbobo.net

Shbobo was founded around 2010 by Peter Blasser and Steve Korn. An alternative name for the company was KORNBLASSER. We decided Shbobo was better because it sound-symbolizes "sh" for data and bobo is the bouncing and alive sound of human gestures. As you can see by the picture, I leaned on Steve a lot and he facilitated a bunch. It was his original idea of taking the analog inventions of Ciat-Lonbarde and making them USB.
