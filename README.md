## About

The shbobo-studies repository is a compilation of research notes and development of software for instruments by Shbobo.

The shbobo-studies repository is a project by [Aar√≥n Montoya-Moraga](https://montoyamoraga.io/), started in 2020.

DISCLAIMER: the contents right now are raw and unorganized, I am finding all the links I can find, and currently going through reading them, copying/pasting them, finding ways to credit the community behind this synthesizers, and documenting the history of its development.
