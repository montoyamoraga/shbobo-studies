## About

The Shat is an instrument by Shbobo.

The neck is marked, with neutral intervals in brass and power chords in steel. 33 frets control computer music, with heart transducer (sensing pressure) and bridge pickup. Two knobs aux Eurorack inputs. Three modes of production: acoustic; add computer music; multiply by computer music (stereo ring mod). USB interfaces to host as does the SHNTH. There is a red light. 

## Tuning

Back to tuning–the shtar shall divide the octave into seventeen equal parts, for 33 total frets. Fourths, fifths and octaves have the customary pearl marker as power spots. Neutral seconds and thirds also have a marker for modal playing. Three strings–a fifth for strumming and an octave for soli.
