;MUL is the same as the MUL that every (finite) opcode has at its tail.
 ;MUL by 128 and you get full volume, 1 is very quiet, and 0 is silent.
 ;Think of MIDI style, volume from 0-128.
 ;The phollowing are all equivalent:
 {(left 
 (mul (horn 64 64) (bar)))} 
 
 {(left 
 (horn 64 64 (bar)))} 
 
 {(left 
 (bar (horn 64 64)))}
